8queens project
The point of this project is to place eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Therefore, each queen has to be on a different row, coloumn and diagonal.
I was able to complete one version of the project but there are multiple solutions I wasnt able to create.
